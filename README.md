# First_Code_Minesweeper
My first dive into learning how to code. It is a minesweeper program that will ask for a board size, difficulty, and then ask for coordinate inputs. 
The gameboard is represented as a grid from a 1d array of random numbers which are used to determine mine frequency. 
A feature i might add to learn more is an ability to set flags, but you will get a victory if no more undiscovered safe tiles exist in the array.

Thank you for testing and providing feedback!
