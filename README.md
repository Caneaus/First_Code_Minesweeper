# First_Code_Minesweeper
My first dive into learning how to code. It is a minesweeper program that will ask for a board size, difficulty, and then ask for coordinate inputs. 
The gameboard is represented as a grid from a 1d array of random numbers which are used to determine mine frequency. 
A feature i might add to learn more is an ability to set flags, but you will get a victory if no more undiscovered safe tiles exist in the array.
It is a cpp file, but i tried to write it with syntax that would only be present in C, and visual studio just handled the compiling somehow. No idea how it works.
Thank you for testing and providing feedback!
